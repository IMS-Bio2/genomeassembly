Genome Assembly 
##################


This is a training project proposal for students

Data sets 
###########

Ecoli or salmon fish. Will add links to download later. 


Assemblers 
#############

1. IDBA 
2. SPAdes 
3. Velvet 


Steps
########

1. Download data sets
2. Trim adaptors and do a quality check 
3. The pipeline is divided here. Run each assembler to assemble the data directly or apply digitial normalization to study the effect of digital normalization on genome assembly. 
4. Evaluate the assembled genome using quast. Per assembler evaluation and also with digital normalization versus without normalization
